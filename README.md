# Mozilla Profiler Builder

Create profiles for mozilla runtimes (like firefox or b2g
desktop).


## Usage Firefox

``` js
var firefox = require('mozilla-profile-builder').firefox;

// launch about:config in firefox for more pref names.
var prefs = {
  // turn on dump so it will output to stdout
  'browser.dom.window.dump.enabled': true,

  // bump up max workers
  'dom.workers.maxPerDomain': 100
};

// this will create a temp dir for a profile that will be
// removed when the process closes... keep: true can be passed
// to turn off the default behaviour
firefox.profile({ prefs: prefs }, function(err, dirPath) {
  
});

```

### Usage B2G

Very similar to firefox but requires a base profile.
The base profile can be passed in or found via the runtime.

``` js
var b2g = require('mozilla-profile-builder').b2g;

// launch about:config in firefox for more pref names.
var prefs = {
  // turn on dump so it will output to stdout
  'browser.dom.window.dump.enabled': true,

  // bump up max workers
  'dom.workers.maxPerDomain': 100
};

var options = {
  userPrefs: prefs,
  runtime: '/Applications/B2G.app',
  // or use the baseProfile directly
  baseProfile: '/Applications/B2G.app/Contents/MacOS/gaia',
  // b2g also has settings which you can preload
  settings: {
    // turn off first run experience
    'ftu.manifestURL': null
  },
  // also apps can be preloaded (packaged apps)
  packagedApps: {
    'origin-for-my-app.com': '/path/to/app'
  }
};

b2g.profile(options, function(err, dirPath) {
  // do stuff
});

```
